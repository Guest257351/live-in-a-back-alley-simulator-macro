# Live in a Back Alley Simulator Macro
A macro for Live in a Back Alley Simulator on roblox. This macro automatically crafts clothing and sells it.  
I made this for fun and im not sure what the game's rules on macros are, so use this at your own risk.  
I may improve this later with things like automatic trash collection and microwaving.
